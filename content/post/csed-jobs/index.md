I've been compiling computing & STEM education and HCI job calls for academic, industry, and non-profit jobs:

**[:scroll: GSheet: Job Calls for Research in CS & STEM Edu, HCI (2021-)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12c65-h725DY9kjy9w5KBV23FH8dG2UAgAM1btdBbzRw/edit?usp=sharing)**

Pass this on to anyone who may be looking to hire for or get hired with this short link: [benjixie.com/csedjobs](https://benjixie.com/csedjobs)

## More info

My goal is to share all job calls I discover to ensure all PhD students researching computing education, STEM education, and HCI & education are aware and familiar with job calls that are relevant to them. One (of many) factors that make job searches an exclusionary experience is that only a select few are aware of job calls that are applicable for a broader audience. So I want to help broadcast job calls to people who may be a few hops further on the social network. Down with the [Hidden Curriculum](https://www.science.org/careers/2019/05/i-felt-lost-new-academic-culture-then-i-learned-about-hidden-curriculum)!

Let me know if you would like to add a job call to the spreadsheet or update an existing one! And see the [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12c65-h725DY9kjy9w5KBV23FH8dG2UAgAM1btdBbzRw/edit#gid=1698698701) to learn more.
