Data can measure the existence and extent of disparities and biases, but judgement is required to interpret and act on data-related findings. This research thread investigates designing critical and equitable human-data interactions that enable stakeholders (e.g. instructors, curriculum designers) to connect their domain expertise with their interpretations of data for equity-oriented outcomes. The long-term goal of this research is to design interactions that contextualize data for situated interpretation and equity-oriented actions.

## Project Publications

- [ICER 2022](/publication/icer-2022): I conducted a critical demography of computing education research to identify and critique trends in how researchers collect, analyze, report, and use demographic data.

- [Dissertation 2022](/publication/dissertation/): My dissertation defined a framework for equity-oriented interpretations of data by considering domain experts' cultural comptence, relevant prior knowledge, and perceptions of power relationships.

- [PACMHCI/CSCW 2022](/publication/cscw-2022): I designed and evaluated StudentAmp, a student feedback tool which contextualized feedback with intersectional demographic data to enable teaching teams of large remote computing courses to take equity-oriented action during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- [L@S 2021](/publication/las-2021): I partnered with curriculum designers from Code.org to address psychometric data on assessment bias by gender and race.

- [SIGCSE 2019](/publication/sigcse-2019): Demonstrated the use of psychometric methods from Item Response Theory to the computing education community by analyzing results from a CS concept inventory.
