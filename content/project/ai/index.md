This research seeks to explore how generative AI tools change what is worth learning about computing, how we teach about computing and AI, and how we assess knowledge. The long-term goal is to develop instruction materials, assessments, and tools to support students critically considering how AI tools augment their skills and capabilities.

## Project Publications

- [ICER 2024](/publication/icer-2024): Used automated benchmarking infrastructure and expert review to understand differences in LLM and student performance on CS assessments with validity evidence.

- [EAAI 2024](/publication/eaai-2024): Conducted curricular co-design with cross-disciplinary high school teachers to identify understand teachers' perspectives on AI, how to integrate learning about AI with disciplinary learning, and how to consider limitations as pedagogical opportunities.

- [EAAI 2024b](/publication/eaai-2024b): Advised students who designed _Prompty_, a tool that scaffolded prompt engineering and output comparison for high school language arts students.

- [Constructionism 2023](/publication/constructionism-2023): Panel to discuss how AI changes constructionism approaches to teaching and learning.

- [CHI AI Literacy Workshop 2023](/publication/chi-ailit-2023): Workshop position paper advocating for a plurality of AI literacies.

## Talks

- [Kapor Center 2024](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VsBqE9ve2xrOi50kClzy56atIvB2Tb6cStTRIHDFSWI/): Presented on ongoing research related to critically learning with and about AI. 

## Funding
This research is funded by a [seed grant](https://acceleratelearning.stanford.edu/story/generative-ai-seed-grants/) from the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, Human-Centered AI Institute (HAI), and OpenAI.
