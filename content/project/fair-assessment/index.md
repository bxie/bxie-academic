Reflecting on our own thought processes is critical to learning programming. But this is often challening for novice programmers because current pedagogical practices do not emphasize it and because learning a new concept is challenging enough!

This project explores how to adapt keystroke-level data from students to model their throught processes as they practice writinge code. We will use this data to inform metacognitive interventions. By doing so, we will explore how to design metacognitive interventions that enable more equitable learning experiences!

This project is in collaboration with the [UW College of Education](https://education.uw.edu/) and [Educational Testing Service (ETS)](https://www.ets.org/research). It is funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation.
