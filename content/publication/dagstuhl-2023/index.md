abstract: "Much of computer science research focuses on techniques to make programming easier, better, less error prone, more powerful, and even more just. But rarely do we try to explain any of these challenges. Why is programming hard? Why is it slow? Why is it error prone? Why is it powerful? How does it do harm? These why and how questions are what motivated the Dagstuhl Seminar 22231 on Theories of Programming. This seminar brought together 28 CS researchers from domains most concerned with programming human and social activities: software engineering, programming languages, human-computer interaction, and computing education. Together, we sketched new theories of programming and considered the role of theories more broadly in programming."
