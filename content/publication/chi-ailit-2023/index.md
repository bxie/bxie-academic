abstract: "Drawing upon current best practices from human-computer interaction, design, and learning sciences literatures, we advocate for an integrative approach working with high school teachers to creating AI literacy resources for use in their teaching. Some distinct emphases in our AI literacy development work is a commitment to educational co-design where teachers are partners in the work, focusing on AI in and across disciplines rather than as a standalone topic, and supporting modularity of resource use."
