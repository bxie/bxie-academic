## Location
My office and lab space are located in the third floor of the Ritchie School of Engineering & Computer Science (ECS) building, located at [2155 E. Wesley Ave. Denver, CO 80210](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UHpHN7Gv42u2jSKU9). The only unlocked outer doors are on the north side of the building, opposite the ponds and E Illif Ave (pictured above). From there you have entered the second floor. You can get up to the third floor via elevator or up the "grand staircase." Offices are odd numbered and on the west side of the building. Lab spaces are even numbered and on the east side of the building.

## Getting to DU
By Transit: The nearest RTD stop, [University of Denver Station](https://app.rtd-denver.com/nextride/stop/33722), is about a mile walk from the ECS building. The nearest [Bus #24 stop](https://app.rtd-denver.com/nextride/route/24) is about a 5 minute (0.2 mi) walk. The nearest [Bus #21 stop](https://app.rtd-denver.com/nextride/route/21) is about a 10 minute (0.4 mile) walk.

By Car: The nearest visitor parking is just south of the Newman Center for the Performing Arts. You can pay with the ParkMobile or PayByPhone app. [Location of the garage entrance](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BopH8TPWksVdDWpN9). As of 2025, visitor parking is ~$2/hr and at most ~$10.50/day. From there, it is less than a five minute walk to the ECS building.
