ðŸ‘‹ **I'm on the job market! Seeking postdoc or research scientist opportunities related to equitable interactions with data. [Learn about my research interests](/hireme).**

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Washington Information School, advised by Prof. [Amy J. Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/) in the Code & Cognition Lab. I am also a research intern at non-profit Code.org. My research interest is in designing interactive tools that support equity in computing education by contextualizing data about students with data from students.

I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow. I was previously an MIT EECS-Google Research and Innovation Scholar during my time as a student at MIT researching with Prof. Hal Abelson and MIT App Inventor.

For more information, see [about me](/about), [projects](#projects), or [CV](/files/cv.pdf).
