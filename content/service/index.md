During my postdoc at Stanford as an [Embedded Ethics Fellow](https://web.archive.org/web/20230923145302/https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/people/benjamin-xie), I co-organized a [conference on _Teaching Responsible Computer Science_](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/teaching-responsible-computer-science) which occurred March 2023 and was attended by over 100 higher education educators and industry affiliates.
