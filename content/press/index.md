## Silly Things Benji was Quoted as Saying
I have a hidden talent of saying silly things to reporters:

> I was just a little camel in the beginning.

Immediately after running 26.2 miles to finish second in the 2020 Disney World Marathon, the [Orlando Sentinel interviewed me](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2020/01/12/arizona-man-denies-fredison-costa-record-tying-8th-disney-world-marathon-title/). The full interview likely didn't make such sense, but the quotes they got from it made even less.

> Tourist Benji Xie said people were swimming at the base of waterfalls when the flash flooding struck. He and his friends ran up to a bathroom with other campers to wait out the rain.

The first (and only?) time the [AP News interviewed me](https://apnews.com/general-news-11d3f78a517f43a3a5541288938b4e79) was after my friends I and got caught in a flash flood in the Havasupai reservation of the Grand Canyon in 2018. To my recollection, I gave an incredible story about how members of the Havasupai Tribe acted swiftly and decisively with limited resources to ensure the safety of some 200 tourists. But instead, they recorded my rich descriptions [and photos](https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/flash-flood-sends-tourists-to-high-ground-near-grand-canyon/article_d66dfcb3-4098-51b3-81d9-391c4d9f16c9.html) of water mixing with sand.
